# Lab on Innovation, Networks, and Knowledge (LINK)

At LINK, we strive to understand and predict group behavior in networks and socio-technical systems. Using techniques that include social network analysis, applied machine learning, and computational social science, we explore ideas around collective intelligence, creation and diffusion of knowledge, and the dynamics of communication and innovation. LINK encourages an interdisciplinary approach to research and scholarship, and collaborates with faculty and students within the School of Communication, McCormick School of Engineering, and Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.

Our research is sponsored by the National Science Foundation.
